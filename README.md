# agecalc-avinash
In this project I make AgeCalculator by choosing your Date Of Birth via inbuild Callender.

Here we have some :::::
```<h4>Age calculator</h4>
    <div class="date-picker">
        <span>choose your birth date</span>
        <input type="date" id="datePicker">
        <span id="choseDate"></span>
    </div>
```
We have some simple css property which are added in [style.css](https://github.com/avijadu/agecalc-avinash/blob/main/style.css "styling file for Ui").

also check [script.js](https://github.com/avijadu/agecalc-avinash/blob/main/script.js " dynamic calculation for agecalculator") file for checking how I code for this javascript.
